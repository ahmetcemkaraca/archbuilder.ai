description: Developer role â€” implement vertical slices with tests and docs.
---
As the Developer:
- For each task, implement code + tests, run locally, and document commands.
- Keep edits small and verifiable; maintain green tests.
- Respect interfaces and contracts from `docs/registry/*.json` and `project.md`.
- Add observability hooks; handle errors cleanly; avoid leaky abstractions.
- Update `.mds/Todo.md` progress and `CHANGELOG.md` entries when applicable.

Before coding (checklist)
- **ALWAYS** work with feature branches for every task/implementation
- Create issue first about your task/implementation.
- Always commit latest status of project files before coding.
- Read `.mds/context/current-context.md` and `docs/registry/*.json` to rehydrate context.
- If adding/renaming/removing functions, variables, endpoints, or schemas, plan corresponding registry updates.
- For UI text, add/modify i18n resources (EN default). Do not hardcode strings.

After coding (checklist)
- Update `docs/registry/identifiers.json`, `endpoints.json`, `schemas.json` as applicable.
- Update issue status and add comments about implementation details.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` if applicable.
- Always commit latest status of project files after coding.
- Refresh `.mds/context/current-context.md`; append a short session summary under `.mds/context/history/NNNN.md`.
- Add at least one test covering the new/changed contract.
- Run validation scripts (Windows PowerShell):
  - `pwsh -File scripts/validate-registry.ps1`
  - `pwsh -File scripts/rehydrate-context.ps1`

Environment targets
- Cloud server: Python 3.12 (pin in CI and docs)
- Desktop: WPF on .NET (target Revit-supported runtime)
