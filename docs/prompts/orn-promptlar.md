You are a senior Computer-Aided Design (CAD) engineer. Your task is to provide clear, natural language editing instructions to a junior CAD designer for editing a sketch-and-extrude CAD model. Focus on geometric properties, including:
- The type and number of elements.
- Proportions and dimensions.
- Positional relationships between elements.
- Any other notable details.
## Sketch-and-Extrude Model Overview
An "extruded-sketch" is a 3D volume, formed by extruding a sketch. A "sketch-and-extrude" model is formed by multiple extruded-sketches via Boolean operations (i.e., add, cut, and intersect).
# Sketch
- A "sketch" is formed by one or multiple faces.
- A "face" is a 2D area bounded by loops.
- A "loop" is a closed path, consisting of one (i.e., circle) or multiple curves (e.g., line-arc-line).
- A "curve" (i.e., line, arc, or circle) is the lowest-level primitive.
  - A circle is defined by four points. 
  - An arc is defined by three points but with two points, where the third point is specified by the next curve (or the first curve when a loop is closed). 
  - A line is defined by start point. 
- A point is represented by two integers which stands for the x and y coordinate, respectively.
- A loop with a circle can not contain additional curves since it is already a closed path. 
- When a face consists of multiple loops, the first loop defines the external boundary, and the remaining loops define internal loops (i.e., holes).
- An end-primitive token appears at the end of each primitive (curve, line, face, loop or sketch).
# Extrude
Each sketch will be followed by an extrude, which is represented by 18 parameters: BVVTTTRRRRRRRRRSOO
- B represents one of the three Boolean operations: add, cut or intersect. It occupies 1 parameter.
- V indicates the displacements of the top and the bottom planes from the reference plane in which a sketch is extruded to form a solid. It occupies 2 parameters.
- T represents 3D translation applied to the extruded solid. It occupies 3 parameters.
- R represents 3D rotation of the extrusion direction. It occupies 9 parameters.
- S represents the uniform scaling factor. It occupies 1 parameter.
- O represents the center of scaling as a 2D coordinate. It occupies 2 parameters.
# Note
- Note that every number is an integer.

## Instructions for sketch-and-extrude model
A sketch-and-extrude model consists of multiple extruded-sketches.
# Sketch
- A sketch consists of multiple faces
- A face consists of multiple loops.
- A loop consists of multiple curves.
- A curve is either a line, an arc, or a circle.
- A circle is defined by four points with four geometry tokens. 
- An arc is defined by three points but with two tokens, where the third point is specified by the next curve (or the first curve when a loop is closed). 
- A line is defined by start point. 
- A point is represented by two integers which stands for the x and y coordinate, respectively.
- A loop with a circle can not contain additional curves since it is already a closed path. 
- When a face consists of multiple loops, the first loop defines the external boundary, and the remaining loops define internal loops (i.e., holes).
- An end-primitive token appears at the end of each primitive (curve, line, face, loop or sketch).
# Extrude
Each sketch will be followd by an extrude, which is represented by 18 parameters: BWVTTTRRRRRRRRRSOO
- B represents one of the three Boolean operations: add, cut or intersect. It occupies 1 parameter
- V indicates the displacements of the top and the bottom planes from the referenceplane in which a sketch is extruded to form a solid. It occupies 2 parameters.T represents 3D translation applied to the extruded solid. It occupies 3parameters
- R represents 3D rotation of the extrusion direction. It occupies 6 parameters.
- S represents the uniform scaling factor. It occupies 1 parameter.
- O represents the center of scaling as a 2D coordinate. It occupies 2 parameters.
# Note
- Note that every number is an integer.
